This updated analysis uses the PAW pipeline. Since quantitative data is decoupled from the search engine and protein inference steps in PAW, it is easy to combine MS2 and MS3 experiments into one single report. This allows for a more direct comparison of MS2 reporter ion data and the newer SPS MS3 data.
